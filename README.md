Garvey Li, Penny King DSC80 Final Project

## Problem Identification

* Prediction problem: Multiclass classification for predicting `CAUSE.CATEGORY` 
* Still have to decide metric

*Clearly state your prediction problem and type (classification or regression). If you are building a classifier, make sure to state whether you are performing binary classification or multiclass classification. Report the response variable (i.e. the variable you are predicting) and why you chose it, the metric you are using to evaluate your model and why you chose it over other suitable metrics (e.g. accuracy vs. F1-score).*

*Note: Make sure to justify what information you would know at the “time of prediction” and to only train your model using those features. For instance, if we wanted to predict your final exam grade, we couldn’t use your Project 5 grade, because Project 5 is only due after the final exam!*

## Baseline Model

*Describe your model and state the features in your model, including how many are quantitative, ordinal, and nominal, and how you performed any necessary encodings. Report the performance of your model and whether or not you believe your current model is “good” and why.*

*Tip: Make sure to hit all of the points above: many projects in the past have lost points for not doing so.*

## Final Model

*State the features you added and why they are good for the data and prediction task. Note that you can’t simply state “these features improved my accuracy”, since you’d need to choose these features and fit a model before noticing that – instead, talk about why you believe these features improved your model’s performance from the perspective of the data generating process.*

*Describe the modeling algorithm you chose, the hyperparameters that ended up performing the best, and the method you used to select hyperparameters and your overall model. Describe how your Final Model’s performance is an improvement over your Baseline Model’s performance.*

*Optional: Include a visualization that describes your model’s performance, e.g. a confusion matrix, if applicable.*

## Fairness Analysis

*Clearly state your choice of Group X and Group Y, your evaluation metric, your null and alternative hypotheses, your choice of test statistic and significance level, the resulting p-value, and your conclusion.*

*Optional: Embed a visualization related to your permutation test in your website.*

*Tip: When making writing your conclusions to the statistical tests in this project, never use language that implies an absolute conclusion; since we are performing statistical tests and not randomized controlled trials, we cannot prove that either hypothesis is 100% true or false.*
